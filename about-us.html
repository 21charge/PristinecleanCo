<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p class="p">This business began as the vision of two individuals who aspired to deliver high-quality media and internet services to a wider audience. Here is their story.</p>

            <h3 class="inline-title">Founder:</h3>
            <h4 class="inline-name">Direndran Kirsten</h4>
            <hr>
<P>Coming from a sales and marketing background, he realized that many businesses were not fully leveraging the potential of the internet era. Inspired by a simple thought—"If they had more presence, they could do better"—he set out to be the person who would help bring that change.</P>

            <h4 class="inline-name">Sashin Pillay</h4>
            <hr>
<p>
    Starting his journey in animation and film production at an animation studio, his passion led him to Cape Town to attend the School of Animation. There, he discovered that film production and media are high-ticket services inaccessible to many. Determined to make these services more widely available, he aimed to broaden access while contributing to the growth of the industry as a whole.</p>
